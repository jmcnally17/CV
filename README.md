# Joseph McNally CV

I am an aspiring developer with experience in Javascript and Ruby, having recently graduated from the Makers Academy coding bootcamp. I also have a masters degree in Astrophysics from Queen Mary University of London with first class honours.
I have thoroughly enjoyed the experience I've had with coding so far due to the analytical approach similar to the experience I had during my degree with a huge feeling of satisfaction when developing a project of my own design.
I feel I am ready to develop my skills further in this industry.

## Skills

__Agile Working__

Practiced agile working during group projects of the Makers main course. When encountering a tough blocker with the login system during the final project (EdUp), we were able to work on other features, such as the noticeboard, in separate branches. These separate branches were then merged and were compatible with the login system once that blocker had been solved. A crucial part of this methodology was having regular meetings everyday to constantly communicate the direction we were going in.

__Project Management__

Gained experience leading a team during the EdUp project as we rotated the team leader role each day. I would direct the three daily team meetings when I was team leader, assigning people to specific roles on the project for that day. This was achieved while making sure everyone got to have their say and a good team atmosphere was maintained throughout. This also displayed my skills in empathy to listen to my colleagues.

__Communication and Presenting__

Constantly working with people during pair programming and group projects throughout the Makers course has required great communication between myself and my colleagues. I also presented the EdUp project along with my team on our demo day. With an audience watching in Zoom, including potential employers and Makers coaches, I explained the teams ways of working as well as the noticeboard and QR code features of our app during the demo video.

## Work Experience

__Supermarket Assistant: Waitrose & Partners__ (October 2018 - April 2021)
- Regularly used strong communication skills to help customers with any issues whilst also requiring teamwork to work with my colleagues in order to solve these issues
- Required time management skills in order to complete a variety of tasks throughout the day such as stock replenishment, monitoring reductions and serving customers in the cafe and bakery section, whilst also showing my ability to adapt and handle multiple responsibilities
- I developed a new method for monitoring stocks of products in the bakery and cafe section of the store which gained me recognition from my store managers and regional manager
    - This method involved going through every product line and correcting the stock count on the handset for that product in order for the computer system to match what we had in reality. How well these matched gave a score which was compared to other branches in the region
    - This required a great attention to detail to monitor each product ticket and to individually count how many of each product was there

## Education

__Makers Academy Coding Bootcamp__ (February 2022 - June 2022)
- Pair programmed with different people everyday during the 12 week main course using good communication to discuss and explain new concepts being learnt, whilst always applying TDD and OOP
- Created a productive and efficient group working environment by using an agile methodology in projects
- Gained leadership experience by leading team meetings and allocating tasks during the final project
- Exercised my self teaching skills to learn new technologies during independent learning and weekend challenges (e.g. ActiveRecord, React). This also required great discipline to maintain this level of work rate, even through weekends
- Showed that I can efficiently learn a new language by translating what I had learnt in Ruby over to a new language when learning Javascript
- Became a mentor to a student on one of the more recent cohorts showing empathy when understanding I was at the same position they were in not long ago

__edX__ (June 2020 - August 2020)
- Achieved a passing grade with 98% in the online module "Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python"
    - I had the opportunity to learn Classes, Objects, Functions, Exceptions and Assertions, Plotting and Algorithms over the course of seven weeks with plenty of practice questions as well as a midterm and final exam
    - I further developed my problem solving skills that I had demonstrated throughout my university degree but with more experience in coding

__Queen Mary University Of London__ (September 2014 - June 2018)
- MSci Astrophysics: First Class Honours
    - During second year, achieved a first in the module "Introduction to C++ Programming"
        - Programmed a simulation of particles colliding in a box
    - Developed strong analytical skills working collectively with my peers when problem solving in weekly coursework in a variety of topics including Thermodynamics, Cosmology, Quantum mechanics and General Relativity
    - Working with peers also required strong teamwork and communication skills in order to explain complex concepts in physics
    - Gained project management skills when writing my dissertation on "Large Scale Structure of the Universe" while running simulations in Gadget Programming to view the evolution of structure for different universes that contain differing amounts of visible matter, dark matter, radiation and dark energy

## Hobbies and Interests

__Rock Climbing__ - Regular bouldering sessions each week. Have previously been on outdoor trips to the Peak District and Fontainebleau in France\
__Running__ - Regular runs each week for some great cardio exercise and feeling healthy and happy\
__Gaming__ - Always enjoy games on my nintendo switch and from steam on my computer
